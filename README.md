`Full stack developer/learner/curious thinker/problem solver`<br>

I'm a Kemyan software engineer focusing on web and mobile app development who studied at the [Dedan Kimathi University of Technology](https://www.dkut.ac.ke/). In addition, I did a one-year software engineering course at [ALx Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/about/). I do projects and solve problems on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) and share I love sharing the things I learn on [hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@Muchemi). Tackling hard things and finding solutions are the reason I love coding and programming.
